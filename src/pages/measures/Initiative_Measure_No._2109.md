## Explanatory Statement  
**Written by the Office of the Attorney General**  

### The Law as It Presently Exists  
The State of Washington imposes various taxes to raise revenue to fund state government. Those taxes include the retail sales tax, the business and occupation tax, the state property tax, and various other state taxes. In 2021, the Legislature passed a law creating a tax on the sale or exchange of certain long-term capital assets, commonly referred to as a "capital gains tax."  

The capital gains tax applies to only some types of capital assets held for longer than a year, such as stocks, bonds, precious metals, or artwork. The tax does not apply to the sale of certain assets, including:  
- real estate;  
- retirement savings accounts or deferred compensation accounts;  
- cattle, horses, or breeding livestock if more than 50 percent of the taxpayer’s income is from farming or ranching;  
- property that is depreciable or that is treated as an expense under identified federal tax laws;  
- timber or timberland, including sales of timber or timberland that result in dividends or distributions from real estate investment trusts;  
- certain commercial fishing privileges; and  
- goodwill received from the qualifying sale of an auto dealership.  

The capital gains tax allows an annual, standard deduction of $250,000 for each taxpayer, which means that the tax applies only to taxpayers who make capital gains over $250,000 in any tax year. For spouses and domestic partners, the combined standard deduction is limited to $250,000, regardless of whether they file joint or separate returns.  

The tax rate is seven percent for covered gains. So, for example, if a person bought $150,000 worth of stock and sold it ten years later for $500,000, they would have a net gain of $350,000. The first $250,000 of that gain would be exempt from tax, and the taxpayer would owe seven percent tax on the remaining $100,000 of gain, for a total capital gains tax due of $7,000.  

The capital gains tax also allows several other deductions, including:  
- gains from the sale or transfer of a qualifying family-owned business that had gross revenue of less than $10 million within the past year; and  
- charitable donations above $250,000, up to a maximum $100,000 deduction.  

The law also sets forth how the tax is administered. It includes provisions for allocating gains to Washington versus other states, credits for certain taxes paid to other states, procedures for filing tax returns, and penalties for attempts to evade payment of the tax. Certain figures, like the standard $250,000 deduction, the qualifying gross revenue for the small-business deduction, and charitable donation amounts, are adjusted annually based on inflation.  

The first $500 million collected from the capital gains tax each year is deposited into the education legacy trust account, which supports K-12 education, expands access to higher education, and provides funding for early learning and childcare programs. Any amounts collected above $500 million are applied to the common school construction account, which funds the construction of facilities for common schools.  

### The Effect of the Proposed Measure if Approved  
If approved, this measure would repeal the capital gains tax law, and Washington State would no longer impose taxes on the sale or exchange of long-term capital assets. This would also eliminate the funding collected from the tax that currently goes to K-12 education, higher education, early learning, childcare, and school construction.  

## Fiscal Impact Statement  
**Written by the Office of Financial Management**  
**For more information visit www.ofm.wa.gov/ballot**  

### FISCAL IMPACT SUMMARY  
If approved by voters, Initiative 2109 will result in an estimated state revenue loss of $2.2 billion over five state fiscal years. This would reduce funding dedicated for K–12 education, higher education, early learning, and child care. Future reductions to funds dedicated for K–12 school construction are possible but not currently forecasted. The estimated net savings for administrative expenses for two state agencies are $10.1 million over five state fiscal years. No local government fiscal impacts are known.  

### GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS  
- The effective date of the initiative is December 5, 2024.  
- The provisions of the initiative apply prospectively, not retroactively.


- The Department of Revenue (DOR) ceases all collection activities on the effective date, including those activities that are in progress.
- Estimates use the state’s fiscal year (SFY) of July 1 through June 30. State fiscal year 2025 is July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025.
- Calendar year refers to January 1 to December 31.

## REVENUE

### Local Revenue
The initiative will not impact local revenue.

### State Revenue
The initiative is estimated to result in revenue loss of $2,163,000,000 over five fiscal years from the Education Legacy Trust Account. The first $500,000,000, indexed to inflation, is deposited into the Education Legacy Trust Account each fiscal year. The Education Legacy Trust Account supports K–12 education, expands access to higher education, and provides funding for early learning and child care programs. Additional revenue is deposited into the Common School Construction Account to fund K–12 school facility construction.

## STATE REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS

Revenue estimates are based on DOR’s excise tax data and the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council (ERFC) June 2024 capital gains tax revenue forecast. Capital gains tax year refers to the calendar year.

The following additional assumptions are made for calculation purposes:
- Forecasted capital gains taxes for tax year 2024, due in April 2025, will not be collected and result in a revenue loss for state fiscal year 2025.
- The long-term growth rate used is the rate forecasted by the ERFC in June 2024.
- The June 2024 capital gains tax forecast assumes zero capital gains tax revenue to the Common School Construction Account; therefore, there is zero revenue impact to this account due to the initiative.

## STATE GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES

### State Agency Implementation Cost Assumptions
State agency savings are estimated to be a net total of $10,147,700 over five state fiscal years as a result of the initiative. Savings by agency are:

### Office of the Attorney General
The Office of the Attorney General (AGO) will save $23,000 in each state fiscal year from 2025 through 2029. This amounts to total savings of $115,000 over this five-year period.

The AGO estimates savings due to less litigation and less need for client advice services. The AGO expects DOR to need minimal legal advice as the department deals with specific cases where taxpayers seek refunds. It is assumed that cases contesting capital gains tax assessments that had not already been paid will drop, because the department can no longer collect the assessed taxes.

### Department of Revenue
The department will save a net of $10,032,700 over the five-year period between 2025 and 2029. It is assumed that the existing State General Fund appropriation for administering the capital gains tax will end as of June 30, 2025. For state fiscal year 2025, the amount already provided is sufficient to administer the capital gains tax without additional funding. For state fiscal years 2026 through 2029, savings of $2,703,000 per state fiscal year are assumed for capital gains tax administration duties that will no longer be required. The department will also incur costs of $779,300 during this period as described below. The department’s duties to administer taxes include maintaining records, processing refunds, and assisting taxpayers with amended returns for up to five prior tax years. Therefore, the department will continue to have costs related to administering the capital gains tax and the related business and occupation (B&O) tax credit for capital gains tax filers for tax years 2022 and 2023 through December 31, 2028. Starting on January 1, 2029, DOR will have additional costs to decommission the capital gains tax and related B&O tax credit in computer systems. It is assumed that the State General Fund will be the funding source for this work.

In state fiscal year 2025, DOR will have costs that will be paid with existing funds for the following activities:
- Updating special notices and excise tax advisories, canceling interim guidance statements and updating other capital gains tax information on the website.
- Amending two administrative rules.


• Administering computer system changes and testing for capital gains tax and related B&O tax credits.

In state fiscal years 2026, 2027, 2028, and 2029, the department will have costs for the following activities:

- Accounting activities related to capital gains tax.
- Processing paper correspondence, responding to web messages, answering phone questions, and assisting taxpayers with reporting and navigating the web reporting portal.
- Processing returns, payments, and all associated work items, including issuing refunds for overpayments.
- Hearing administrative reviews that provide taxpayers with an informal, non-adversarial dispute resolution process for reviewing a disputed department action, such as a denial of a refund request or tax ruling. The department will incur additional costs if the dispute continues to the Board of Tax Appeals or the courts.
- Making necessary computer system changes and performing required computer system testing as service packs and core system upgrades occur.

In state fiscal year 2029, the department will also have costs to decommission the capital gains tax and related B&O tax credit in the computer system and to perform related required computer system testing.

## Argument for "Yes" on I-2109

- **Repeals Washington’s new backdoor income tax.**  
  Washingtonians have overwhelmingly rejected an income tax 11 times, yet lawmakers disregarded the voters’ wishes and passed a capital gains income tax. Voting "Yes" on I-2109 upholds the will of the people. The IRS, every other state, and the dictionary classify capital gains as income.

- **Protects home sales and retirement savings from tax expansion.**  
  While proponents claim that "only the rich will pay," this capital gains income tax is clearly intended to expand and pave the way for a statewide income tax. The Senate author stated, "Adopting a capital gains tax is one of the best things we could do to help advance the possibility of an income tax in our state." Protect your home and retirement by voting "Yes."

- **Maintains the State’s education funding guarantee.**  
  Washington’s constitution mandates full funding for public education. Our public education system receives over $18,500 per student per year, one of the highest in the country. Voting "Yes" on I-2109 ensures our children’s education remains fully funded without new taxes.

- **Protects working families, small business, and tech innovation.**  
  If we continue down this path, we risk driving family-wage jobs and job creators out of Washington as they relocate to states with lower tax rates. Voting "Yes" on I-2109 helps ensure Washington remains a center of innovation, opportunity, and family-wage jobs.

## Argument against "No" on I-2109

- **Stop Cuts To Education, School Construction, and Childcare.**  
  I-2109 eliminates billions of dedicated education dollars– worsening our school funding crisis, reducing access to affordable childcare and early learning, and cutting investments in crumbling schools. I-2109 also eliminates funds from pre-K, special education, job training, and community colleges. Cuts will force job losses in childcare and education at a time when we need more support for kids and families– not less.

- **Less Than 1% Of Washingtonians Pay Extraordinary Profits Tax.**  
  Retirement funds, real estate, small family-owned businesses, and farms are all exempt from the capital gains tax. In fact, less than 1% of Washingtonians will pay this tax; it only applies to stock sale profits over $250,000 per year.

- **Reject Washington’s Upside Down Tax Code.**  
  Washington has the nation’s second most upside down tax code, with middle-class families paying a three times larger share of their income on state and local taxes than the wealthiest households. Super wealthy Washingtonians should pay a fair share for education and early learning.

- **Teachers And Childcare Providers: “Don’t Let A Hedge Fund Millionaire Buy This Election.”**  
  I-2109 is sponsored by hedge fund millionaire Brian Heywood, who will personally benefit from this initiative. Teachers, childcare providers, early learning experts, K-12 leaders, parents, and small business owners are united in urging you to vote No. Don’t give the super wealthy a tax cut that will harm kids, and shift the tax bill to the rest of us.

## Rebuttal of argument against

- The legislature is constitutionally required to fund education and has ample funding. When this tax passed, we had a $3 billion surplus followed by $15 billion the next year. Sufficient funding exists. While the current tax has exemptions, it is clearly a steppingstone to a statewide income tax. Vote yes, as voters have 11 times before, to protect your home and retirement from additional taxes and ensure job creators continue coming to our state.

## Rebuttal of argument for

- Here are the facts: 99.8% of Washingtonians will not pay the capital gains on extraordinary stock profits – it only applies to stock sale profits over $250,000 per year. The law clearly exempts retirement and college savings, as well as sale of real estate, farms, and small businesses. Join small business owners and workforce development leaders counting on affordable childcare for employees, and tax fairness for middle-income families– please vote No.
