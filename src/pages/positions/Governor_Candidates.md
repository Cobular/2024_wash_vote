# Governor | 4-year term

## Bob Ferguson  
*(Prefers Democratic Party)*

### Elected Experience  
- Attorney General. Reelected with 67%, winning 37 of Washington’s 39 counties. An independent leader, Bob manages Washington’s largest law office. He protects the rights of all Washingtonians, prosecutes criminals, and stops price-gouging that harms families.

### Other Professional Experience  
- Bob began his professional career in Eastern Washington. He worked with federal judges appointed by presidents of both parties. Bob represented taxpayers, local governments, and small businesses. Growing up, he worked delivering newspapers and washing dishes at a senior home.

### Education

### Community Service  
- Bob served in the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, managing an emergency services office assisting vulnerable individuals and tutoring kids.

### Statement  
- Son of a special education public school teacher and a Boeing employee, Bob takes on the toughest fights, solves problems, and gets things done for you—not powerful interests. He is the only candidate who refuses campaign contributions from corporate PACs and large corporations. Never satisfied with the status quo, he’ll protect your rights and deliver change for Washington.
- As Governor, Bob’s top priority is improving public safety. He’ll hire more police officers to combat crime and fentanyl. He took on powerful drug companies, winning $1.2 billion for increased treatment and first responders. Nurses, firefighters, and prosecutors endorse Bob because they trust him to combat public drug use and improve the mental health system. Bob worked alongside law enforcement to end the rape kit backlog and bring justice to survivors. He knows how to bring people together to solve big challenges.
- Bob and his wife Colleen, who works at a community college, are raising teenage twins. Bob knows high housing prices make it hard for too many families. He’ll work with both parties for commonsense solutions to address homelessness and rising housing costs—building 200,000 affordable homes in four years. Bob will increase opportunities for every Washingtonian to get ahead by investing in career education, skills training, and apprenticeships.
- Bob understands our democracy is threatened and successfully blocked dozens of illegal Trump administration actions. As Governor, he’ll defend our democracy and protect Washingtonians. A champion for reproductive freedom, Bob is the only candidate endorsed by Pro-Choice Washington and Planned Parenthood.
- In contrast, Congressman Dave Reichert said, “I love Donald Trump’s policies,” and voted with Trump 92.5% of the time. Reichert repeatedly voted to impose a nationwide abortion ban that criminalizes doctors and to abolish the Affordable Care Act. Reichert opposes marriage equality. Bob fights for us.

### Statement  
For nearly 40 years our state has been lost in a wilderness of one-party rule. What has that gotten us? The highest violent crime rate in our history, friends and family dying from fentanyl, record homelessness, and the worst maintained roads, highways, and ferries in America. As your governor, I will work tirelessly to foster an economy that works for everyone, safe streets and neighborhoods, and ensure the children in our state get a world class education.  

From the United States Air Force to the King County Sheriff’s Office, I witnessed examples of selfless sacrifice, individuals who put others before themselves. That experience taught me what it means to have a servant’s heart, honored by an opportunity to help, and driven to show the courage and humility it takes to get things done. As King County Sheriff, I arrested violent criminals and locked up human traffickers who preyed on women and children. On my watch crime was down as we enforced the law and everyone was accountable. This experience served me well when the people of Washington sent me to Congress where I worked with Republicans and Democrats to pass big and bold policies on everything from taxes to trade to protecting our beautiful environment.  

We’ve been living in a state where our leaders have pit region against region, generation against generation, and yes even family against family. Dividing people is not the answer. We must work together, side by side, to tackle the issues we all face. I have been endorsed by nearly every sheriff in the state and people of all party affiliations – Republican, Independent, Democrat – are joining our campaign because they understand that business as usual is no longer an option.  

I would be honored to have your support to be your next governor.
