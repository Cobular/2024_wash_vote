### Statement
Ever since my daughter was born critically ill in the NICU and I had to fight my insurance company to allow her doctors to provide life-saving care, I have made it my life’s mission to ensure no family ever has to go through that same trauma. With my experience as a litigator representing workers in employment discrimination cases and my strong background in advocacy and public service, I bring a unique set of qualifications to the role of Insurance Commissioner.  
As Insurance Commissioner, I’ll work tirelessly to enact policies that prioritize consumer protection and lowering costs, promote transparency within the insurance industry, and expand access to essential healthcare services for all Washingtonians.  
I have spent my life helping the powerless stand up to those with the most power, and I respectfully ask for your vote so I can fight for you too.

### Statement
I’m running to make Washington’s insurance market more affordable for families and seniors. Misguided activist policies of the Legislature and the Insurance Commissioner have limited choice and made insurance unaffordable.  
How much businesses pay for insurance has a direct impact on the prices you pay for things, including groceries and even your rent. Add to that a 20% increase in insurance costs, and it’s even harder for seniors on fixed incomes and families to make ends meet.  
As Insurance Commissioner, I’ll work to lower costs, provide predictability and availability in Washington’s insurance markets, so you can get the insurance protection your family deserves.
