### Statement  
Thank you for the privilege and opportunity to serve as your Lieutenant Governor for the last four years. The most important part of being Lieutenant Governor is serving as President of the State Senate and presiding in an impartial way, fairly applying the rules to everyone and to both parties. We have done this.  

But the office of Lieutenant Governor also affords the opportunity to advocate for important policy priorities. We have advocated long, consistently and clearly for the need to more forcefully address the housing crisis in our state, especially for affordable homes for low and moderate income families. Our work helped lead to many accomplishments last year, causing the 2023 session to be called The Year of Housing. So much work remains to be done. We will stay at it.  

We have also worked hard and in a bipartisan way, to improve our civic health. We all know it needs to change. We need more respectful discourse in the public square, more inclination to try to find principled compromises and when we cannot, a greater ability to disagree better. Here, too, we will doggedly stay at it.  

In this spirit, I humbly ask for your support.

### Statement  
Professionally, my role has been to safely navigate to every destination, knowing people’s lives depended on me. As your Lieutenant Governor, my focus will remain: People working together. From presiding over the State Senate to building bridges throughout government, I seek to establish a climate of cooperation and constructive leadership, restoring confidence in our government.  

Career politicians fail us when they deliver dictates, division, and dependency rather than diplomacy and respect. I have stepped forward to help fix a broken system. One political party has controlled our state for decades, representing powerful, big-money interests, growing more extreme, even radical. We must resolve to change course, finding common ground.  

JFK challenged: “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” I will seek to always advance relationships, balance, and communication, providing a unifying voice and vision for all.  

Compelled by faith, hope, and love, I will stand for your rights and our children’s future, fulfilling the high calling of serving the public trust with honor and integrity, of service above self. This is my commitment to you. Thank you for trusting me as a thoughtful, deliberate change agent for our future.
