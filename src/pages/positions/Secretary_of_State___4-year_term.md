### Statement  
As your Secretary of State, my top priorities are ensuring Washington’s elections are secure and accessible for every eligible voter. Since 2021, I’ve safeguarded the integrity of our elections by investing in cyber and physical security, fighting malicious election disinformation, and providing eligible voters every ability to participate in our democratic process.  

I will protect Washington’s proven and dependable vote-by-mail system. I fought to expand automatic voter registration and increase civic engagement, lowering barriers for eligible citizens.  

Overseeing Washington’s State Library, I confronted book bans and censorship in public libraries across our state. I’ve increased access to business services and secured resources to preserve our state’s history. I’m endorsed by County Auditors who conduct elections, the Washington State Labor Council, business leaders, voting rights advocates, prominent state and federal leaders, and former Governors Gary Locke and Christine Gregoire.  

I am proud of my career in public service working alongside Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. Washington’s Secretary of State must possess the highest standards of integrity and leadership and serve as a strong advocate for voter access. It is the privilege of my life to serve as your Secretary of State, and I would be honored to earn your vote.

I am running for Secretary of State because Election Transparency is the most important issue on the ballot. We must instill confidence in the electorate that our elections process and infrastructure are accessible, transparent, and secure. This includes giving the public a closer look inside our elections process and bringing back in person voting in addition to our mail-in voting.  

The Secretary of State’s office also has an important duty to the incredible businesses throughout Washington in making sure the government red tape does not impede on entrepreneurs ability to create and run their businesses in the state. When I am elected Secretary of State I will work with the Governor and State House to make Washington the most business friendly state in the country.  

I have lived in Spokane since 2008 when I emigrated from the United Kingdom to the United States. My wife and I both run small businesses in Spokane, we have two children and a grandchild, we have established our roots here, and we truly love the beauty we have here in Washington State.
