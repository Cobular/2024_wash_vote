### Statement  
As the first woman to serve as Washington State Auditor, I lead an office responsible for conducting independent audits across all local governments and state agencies, ensuring accountability and transparency in public fund usage. Over my eight-year tenure, responsibilities have expanded, including significant audits of federal COVID-19 pandemic funds. My administration has also greatly reduced the number of “unauditable” governments, increasing our audits’ scope and effectiveness. Under my leadership, we exposed nearly $7 million in misappropriated funds at a local housing agency, the largest fraud case in our state’s history. We have strengthened our capabilities by training more fraud examiners and launching innovative programs. These include a pioneering audit of law enforcement’s use of deadly force, bolstering cybersecurity with increased IT audits and preventive “cyber-checkups,” and a new data analytics program to detect fraud and waste more effectively. I will continue these efforts in my next term, focusing on managing public resources wisely. My vision includes advancing our technological capabilities to protect public assets and promote integrity across Washington State. Many have endorsed me; details are on my website. I have a proven and tested public record of leadership. I humbly ask for your vote to continue our progress.

### Statement  
Working in the private sector for 35 years, within a variety of industries, Hawkins has the skills to work with teams of professionals to improve processes and systems. Solutions to our challenges with education, the homeless, mental health, parental rights, property rights, taxes and energy policy can all be found through transparency in audits. Observing the divide within our country over the past 4 years, Hawkins began asking questions to learn what is happening. An active study of the election system within Washington during this time has revealed the fact that there have been no Audits of the election systems in Washington State, to the same professional standards as are expected in the private sector. Hawkins further learned of the newly created roadblocks to public transparency, as the public is looking for answers. Taxpayers benefit from transparency and accountability. A search for Truth matters. Hawkins is married to Paula and together they have a family of 10 children. They realize that strong communities benefit from family centered policies. Transparency and Accountability are key building blocks to ensure that children become valued contributors to society. Audits are a great way to understand our past, as we make decisions for our future.
