I support constitutional rights and liberties, reducing government spending, lowering onerous taxation, election integrity, parental rights, school choice, local zoning and planning, single family housing, and reducing crime (drug trade, and human trafficking). I am opposed to state and local income tax, expansive executive powers of our governor, defunding the police, cap and trade, and government insurance schemes.
