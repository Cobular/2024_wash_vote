### Statement  
The course we are on is not sustainable, leaving little hope for hard-working families, individuals or young people. As a voting Democrat for 25 years, the policies of the Democratic party no longer serve us. The Republican-backed Let’s Go Initiatives are a voice of what the people want. My priorities include returning our schools to academic excellence while protecting parental rights; creating policies that support small businesses; putting money back into the hands of hard-working men, women and families; and ensuring what is being put into our water, food, or sprayed in the air is safe for everyone.
