### Statement  
Voters are tired of being ignored by state representatives who are grossly out of touch, and who consistently pass legislation making things worse. Democrats handcuffed police, and crime exploded. Washington is now the 8th most dangerous state, and is the epicenter of the fentanyl crisis. Our incumbents voted for higher gas prices and raised taxes on top of record inflation.  

I look forward to serving as your representative in Olympia where, among other things, I will support the six common sense initiatives put forward this year restoring police pursuit, ensuring parental notification, and cutting taxes. I would appreciate your vote!
