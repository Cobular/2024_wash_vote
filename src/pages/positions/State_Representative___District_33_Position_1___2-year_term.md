## George Richter  
*(Prefers Republican Party)*  

### Elected Experience  
- No information submitted  

### Other Professional Experience  
- I have been a General Manager for Revere Insurance Group and Provident Insurance Group. Currently I am an Employee Benefit Specialist with multiple West Coast insurance companies. I have been self-employed and running my own insurance business for the last 24 years.  

### Education

### Community Service  
- I was an executive board member of a large children’s charity, where I was instrumental in securing funding and overseeing construction of a children’s residential facility. I am passionate about the education, development and welfare of our youth.  

### Statement  
I am running for office to introduce common sense back into our state government and support legislation that will restore safety, security and financial wellness to our community. For years, laws have been enacted without regard for the unintended consequences to our families, and the businesses that support them. Our government was designed to work with checks and balances. This has been lacking in Olympia and resulted in laws that do not reflect our community’s needs. With my background in business and charitable organizations, I can work to restore the balance so badly needed in our state government.
