### Statement  
Thank you for the honor of representing you in Olympia. I am proud of the progress our state has made – leading the nation in fighting climate change, protecting reproductive freedom, preventing gun violence. This term, I became House Majority Leader, in which role I have helped write fiscally responsible state budgets that invest in education, healthcare, and public safety.  
On all of these issues, more work remains – for affordability, safety, equity, and sustainability. Transportation, education, and housing require more support and investment. I ask for your vote, to continue delivering for our communities and to strengthen our state.

### Statement  
King County was once a safe and thriving community, but it’s been thrown into disarray by bad policy. Elected officials have had years to fix it, but things are getting worse. My grandfather served in WWII. He taught me that when the world goes wrong, we must do what we can to set it right. So, I got involved - first as PCO and LD Chair, then by helping to write our party platforms. Now I’m running to serve you in Olympia.  
With your help, we can fix this. With your vote, we can put a representative back in our House.
