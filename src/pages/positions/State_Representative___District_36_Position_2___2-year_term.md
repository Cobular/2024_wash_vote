### Statement  
Let me be your voice for limited government. I will fight for tax relief, accountability, and pushing back government encroachment on our privacy and freedom. We can’t build our way out of the affordable housing crisis when the root is burdensome debt. We should maintain our essential social services but let Republicans do it better with programs that support family structure and encourage savings.  
I am a Pro-Choice Republican. Our Washington State laws on abortion are rooted in our common law traditions and should be protected. Conservative values are gaining momentum – Vote yes on the initiatives in November.
