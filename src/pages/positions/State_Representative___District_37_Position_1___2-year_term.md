### Statement
I was raised in South Seattle, my home for more than 50 years, and proudly represent our voices in Olympia. I have held state government accountable for protecting our civil rights, secured financial resources for local non-profits, and worked to create fairer opportunities for students and for small businesses.  
I am committed to eliminating inequalities in public education beginning with a transformation of our 19th century education system. Instead, we should adopt educational engagement strategies focusing on student agency and delivering deeper learning experiences to meet the 21st century needs of our learners and society, now and into the future.
