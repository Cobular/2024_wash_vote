### Statement  
- Raised in a working-class neighborhood and a proud product of public schools, I understand the challenges families face. This drives my work in Olympia where I championed housing affordability, protecting reproductive rights, investing in behavioral and mental health, and fixing our regressive tax code. These are hard issues, and I get results. I secured over $69 million for projects in the 37th LD to help our community thrive. Building relationships resulted in my election to House leadership as Vice Chair of the Democratic caucus.  
- Endorsed by unions, reproductive health organizations, and housing advocates. I hope to earn your vote again.
