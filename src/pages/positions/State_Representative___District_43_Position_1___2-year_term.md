### Statement
It’s been an honor serving as your State Representative. I’ll continue championing issues that are dear to my heart and represent our shared Democratic values: reducing homelessness, investing in affordable housing, expanding behavioral and mental health services, protecting abortion access, and tackling climate change.  
This last session we made great progress on these issues while also improving public safety, addressing the fentanyl crisis, and reducing gun violence. We have more work to do to expand accessible and affordable housing, ensure equitable access to public education, create a sustainable transportation system, uphold LGBTQ civil rights, and reduce carbon emissions further.
