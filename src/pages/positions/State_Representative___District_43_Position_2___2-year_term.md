## Andrea Suarez  
*(Prefers Democratic Party)*  

### Elected Experience  
- Democratic Precinct Committee Officer, 43rd District Democrats  

### Other Professional Experience  
- Founder and Executive Director, We Heart Seattle.  
- Manager, DHL Logistics.  

### Education  
- Bachelors, Oregon State University.  

### Community Service  
Out of heartache and frustration with local leaders, I founded a non-profit called "We Heart Seattle" to support children and adults in need. We Heart removes trash and needles from public spaces. We also provide individualized assistance to our homeless neighbors by cutting red tape to house them quickly and efficiently. For those with addiction issues, we get them treatment. I know my practical experience will make a big difference in Olympia!  

### Statement  
I am a proud Democrat who has led thousands of hours of volunteer fieldwork helping the homeless, addicted, and mentally ill. It’s obvious our system is failing to help the most vulnerable members of our community. It’s failing because there is a lack of practical, hands-on expertise down in Olympia. I am ready to fill that void.  
As a woman, I have been shocked by the recent attacks on reproductive rights. I will stand for the right to choose. I also plan to fight for rent affordability, equitable public safety, and environmental protection. I humbly ask for your vote.
