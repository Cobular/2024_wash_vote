### Statement  
I’m running to give voters an alternative. I support lower taxes, public safety, women’s and girls’ sex-based rights, parental rights, and First Amendment freedoms. Many voters, like me, have been ignored by our state representatives. We feel unheard as politicians pass tax increases amid inflation, limits on law enforcement amid skyrocketing crime, and limits on parental rights amid public school curriculum mandates.  
I’m looking forward to helping fix what’s broken in Washington, including supporting the six common-sense initiatives put forward this year to restore police pursuit, ensure parental notification and cut taxes. I would appreciate your vote.
