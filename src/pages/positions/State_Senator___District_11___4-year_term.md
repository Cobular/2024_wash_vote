### Statement
As a lifelong 11th District resident, I understand what’s important for our District and work hard every day to serve you. I’ve spent my career fighting for family wage jobs, working families, civil rights, equity and small businesses. I stand on my principles and get the job done, which is why my colleagues elected me Chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus. I reflect our community’s strong work ethic and am honored to bring our values of social and economic justice to Olympia.

I believe in fiscal prudence, which includes transparency, accountability and generating revenue without raising regressive taxes. Creating a publicly owned state bank does all that and more: it creates tens of thousands of jobs, saves us bonding, interest and fee money while also drastically increasing our infrastructure financing capacity, and keeps our tax dollars in Washington working for us, rather than creating profits for Wall Street. Now more than ever, we need innovative fiscal solutions and I’m proud to be leading on this and other critical policies like universal healthcare and housing affordability.

Thank you for your continued confidence in me to represent you. Let’s build on our legislative successes and create a better future for our community.
