### Statement
As the only statistician in the State Legislature, I will always rely on science, data, and facts to make the best decisions for the people of Washington. My goal is to build consensus, reach across the aisle and get results for our district and the state.

We have made progress increasing the supply of affordable housing, but we have much more work to do. The state needs to step up and help local governments reduce the backlog of permits and urgently increase housing so young families can afford to live here. We must also ensure first responders have the tools and resources to keep our neighborhoods safe. I will prioritize expanding access to affordable healthcare and always defend your right to reproductive freedom.

We need to make sure every tax dollar is spent with transparency and accountability. I know itâ€™s your money, and our responsibility is to spend it wisely. This means crafting a sustainable budget for the long term that prioritizes schools and builds opportunity for everyone.
