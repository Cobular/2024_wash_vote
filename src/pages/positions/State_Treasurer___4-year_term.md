Mike rejects all corporate campaign donations. He puts your financial interests first. As State Treasurer, Mike refinanced all eligible debt, redirecting over $550 million in Wall Street profits back to the people.  

Mike implemented a policy prohibiting Washington State Treasurers from investing in corporations that fund their campaigns. His investments earned Washington $1.8 billion over the next four years to reduce taxpayer burdens. Mike’s local government investment returns are 50 times higher than 2021, sending $3 million more each day to local governments for schools, first responders, and other community needs.  

Under Mike’s leadership as State Treasurer, Washington now has budget guardrails. U.S. News just ranked our state’s long-term fiscal stability the best in the nation. Our state pensions are one of America’s best funded. Washington maintains a Moody’s AAA-credit rating, the top mark for strong financial management. This makes housing, road, ferry, and school construction more affordable. Mike lowered GET/529 education costs for families, while keeping this important program fully funded.  

Mike expanded financial education opportunities. He also created an online "Transparency Portal" to show how your public dollars are managed. Endorsed by Washington State Labor Council and Planned Parenthood, Mike will always put working families and retirees first!

### Statement  
As your State Treasurer, I will advocate for the protection of our state’s assets and ensure retirement accounts make sound investments. I will strive to make the accounting system transparent and accountable to citizens. With my professional expertise, I will scrutinize the books and challenge the legislature to exercise greater caution in tax and spending decisions.  

As a CPA, I have dedicated my career to helping clients preserve their bottom lines, reduce taxes, and secure their futures. I developed and taught a financial literacy class to junior high students and testified before the legislature against raising taxes and over-regulating our businesses.  

My experience includes advising taxpayers and businesses in our community on wise investments and job creation. In an era of job uncertainty, rising prices, and constant demands for education funding, Olympia’s typical solution is to raise taxes and fees. My approach is to account for past expenditures and prioritize sensibly. I will be the accountant Treasurer who leads our state into a new era of fiscal responsibility.  

Vote to preserve our fiscal future. Vote for accountability. Vote for Sharon Hanek.
