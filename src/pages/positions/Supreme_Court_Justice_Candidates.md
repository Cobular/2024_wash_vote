### Statement
I am the only candidate endorsed by 8 of the 9 current Washington Supreme Court Justices. Over 100 judges believe I’m the most qualified candidate for this office. I am also the only candidate with significant appellate experience having argued at every level of state and federal appellate courts including the U.S. Supreme Court.

I was raised in a working-class family in Lakewood. My parents taught me the value of hard work, fairness, family, and faith. I have always given back to the community, including by representing people for free when they couldn’t afford a lawyer, serving on boards of directors of nonprofits devoted to improving access to justice, and lobbying lawmakers to increase funding for civil legal aid. Promoting equal access to the legal system has been an important part of my practice.

Over the past 40 years as a lawyer, I have been recognized for my legal skills, including being named to "Best Lawyers in America" since 2011. I am rated "Exceptionally Well Qualified" by six bar associations, and am endorsed by the Washington Labor Council, Gov. Inslee, Attorney General Ferguson, and by over 40 other elected leaders.

I would appreciate your support, and your vote.

### Statement
Judge Dave Larson is the only candidate with judicial experience. Judge Larson is the only candidate with a record of keeping our communities safe from crime. Judge Larson is the only candidate running a traditional bi-partisan campaign. Judge Larson knows Washington has the best state Constitution in America, offering stronger protections for our civil rights than the U.S. Constitution. He will protect individual rights.

We all know crime is a serious issue and Judge Larson has a nearly two-decade record of keeping us safe from crime as a trial judge. His innovative reforms have been recognized nationwide; many of his ideas have been adopted by our legislature. These reforms are supported by other judges, police chiefs and sheriffs, mayors, legislators, and the people who work directly with those suffering from addiction and untreated mental illness.

Judge Larson is the only candidate running a campaign that reaches out to Democrats and Republicans, Labor and Business, Eastern and Western Washington, and everyday citizens. We can return to a less political and more trusted court system by voting for Judge Larson.

Judge Larson’s leadership, innovations, intellect, ethics, and commitment to fairness make him exactly what we need on our state Supreme Court.
