Trump will implement policies to bring down inflation, create better trade deals, and prioritize American jobs and industries.  
Donald J. Trump believes in a strong and prosperous America. He will restore economic stability, secure our borders, and make America a leader on the world stage again.

As president, Kennedy will end the foreign wars, reign in the military industrial complex, and reinvest the trillions saved at home to restore the middle class. He has plans to:  
1. Redirect 20% of government contracts away from megacorporations that offshore our economy and into small businesses, creating millions of jobs and an economic boom;  
2. Offer a new GI Bill to anyone willing to serve their community in our domestic Peace Corps, providing corps members with enough life-changing assets to pay their way through college, put a downpayment on a home, or start a small business;  
3. Assist homebuyers with government-guaranteed 3% mortgages;  
4. Cap childcare at 10% of income, so families can achieve the American dream of homeownership and affordable parenthood.

---  

## Statement  
The political system is broken. The two Wall Street parties are bought and paid for. Both are abandoning working people, worsening the climate crisis, undermining democracy, and squandering trillions on the endless war machine while tens of millions of Americans lack housing, food, healthcare, and more.  
Over 60% of us now say the two-party system has failed and we need a party that serves the people. I’m running for President to offer that choice for the people. Our campaign is the only anti-war, anti-genocide, pro-worker, climate action choice with a path to the White House.  
Political insiders smear voters who want better choices. But without freedom of choice in elections, there is no democracy. So forget the elites who tell you to ignore your struggle and to keep voting for the politicians who caused it. Change won’t come from them; it has to come from the people.  

If we come together, we can create an economy that works for all of us with living-wage jobs, healthcare, housing, food, childcare, debt-free education, and guaranteed livable income as human rights. We can create a Green New Deal with millions of jobs to fight climate collapse, secure clean air, water, and food, and protect Mother Earth.  
We can end endless war, rampant militarism, and genocide, and launch a new foreign policy based on diplomacy, international law, and human rights. We can revive our democracy with ranked-choice voting, proportional representation, and public campaign financing to get big money out of politics. We can end mass incarceration, fix our immigration system, and ensure our rights, freedoms, and justice for all.  
We have the power to do all this and more - and we can use it in 2024 to start building an America and a world that works for all of us.

## Statement  
Humanity is experiencing a massive existential crisis — climate catastrophe, massive job losses, and war between the U.S. and other nuclear-armed powers. The capitalist government has no answers to these crises, and is in fact driving them forward, acting as a servant for the Big Banks, Big Tech, Big Oil and the Military-Industrial Complex. In every crisis that the people face, whether it’s hurricanes, wildfires or pandemics, the government has proven itself to be totally inept and to only care about profit. They can’t steer us away from crises — they are part of them.  
Most people in the country are living paycheck to paycheck, the cost of everything has skyrocketed, and the ten richest men have doubled their fortunes. But both major, pro-capitalist parties are saying that nothing can be done — that this is just how the economy works. We disagree!

The resources exist to resolve the problems humanity faces. The only things that stand in the way are the politicians that manage affairs for the billionaires who generate super-profits from workers all over the globe.  
We stand for socialism — a system where poor and working people hold political and economic power and use it to meet the needs of all people and to preserve the planet. Every gain working people have attained has been through organized struggle and mass movements. We are part of building a movement of working class people committed to eradicating the dictatorship of the billionaires, and building the future we deserve. Join the movement, vote socialist 2024!

### Elected Experience

### Other Professional Experience  
Active in industrial unions over decades, currently hotel worker in Miami Beach, member of UNITE/HERE Local 355.  

### Education  
Participant in movements against the Vietnam War, against Jim Crow segregation and for women’s emancipation, learned that the working class must replace capitalism and fight for political power as workers and peasants did in the 1959 Cuban Revolution.  

### Community Service  
Speaking out across the U.S. for the working-class to form a party of labor, independent of the capitalist parties, and to oppose all acts and threats of Jew hatred while defending Israel’s right to exist as a refuge for Jews worldwide.  

## Dennis Richter  
**Socialist Workers Party**  
**Nominee**  
**Vice President**  

### Elected Experience  
No information submitted  

### Other Professional Experience  
Airline food service worker and recent member of UNITE HERE union. Over five decades working as union industrial worker on the railroad, in steel, and in meatpacking.  

### Education  
In high school in the 1960’s Richter was drawn to the massive Black-led proletarian movement that tore down Jim Crow segregation, strengthening the U.S. working class.  

### Community Service  
Opponent of Washington’s world-wide imperialist exploitation of workers and farmers. Organized and participated in demonstrations against the U.S. rulers’ wars in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Walked picket lines and built solidarity with UAW strike last year and locked-out Boeing firefighters in 2024.  

## Statement  
We live in a deeply class-divided country ruled by a handful of billionaire families and their government. Working people are facing the devastating effects of high prices, lack of good paying jobs, unsafe working conditions and schedules that often make political, family, social and union life impossible. Life expectancy is at the lowest in a quarter century and the birthrate has been cut in half since 1950.  

Today workers are in a mood to fight, organizing, and using their unions to defend their lives and livelihoods. We need to fight for a public works program to put millions to work at union scale wages, for wages and cost of living increases to meet price increases, and for workers control of production to guarantee safety on the job and reverse the profit-driven destruction of the environment.  

We must defend constitutional freedoms won in struggle—freedoms of worship, speech, press, association, the right to bear arms and more. Frame-up attempts to jail and silence political opponents deal a blow to rights working people need.

---  

## Statement  
The Socialist Equality Party calls for the socialist reorganization of society that ends the dictatorship of the corporate-financial oligarchy and transfers political power to the working class; establishes public ownership of and democratic control over multi-billion dollar corporations and financial institutions and, thereby, restructures the economy to meet the needs of mass society—full employment, workplace safety, the abolition of poverty, universal health care, affordable housing, high-quality education, child care, secure retirement, expansion of cultural and recreational facilities—rather than the accumulation of massive corporate profits and private fortunes; secures peace and democracy through the abolition of the military-industrial complex and the massive network of state intelligence agencies.

The Socialist Equality Party declares that the 2024 election is dominated by three critical issues:

1. First, the reckless militarism of the Democratic and Republican parties—seeking to secure the global interests of the financial-corporate oligarchy—has brought the United States to the very brink of World War III. The US-NATO war in Ukraine and the genocidal war in Gaza are part of a broader struggle for world domination.
2. Second, democracy in the US is giving way to authoritarianism, in which the Democrats and Republicans are implicated. Political dictatorship is the outcome of unrestrained corporate economic power.
3. Third, social inequality has reached levels unprecedented in modern US history. This country has the highest concentration of billionaires in the world, whose collective wealth stands at a record $5.2 trillion. The wealth of the 10 richest billionaires exceeds that of the collective wealth of half the US population. The SEP calls for the expropriation of billion-dollar fortunes and massive increase in taxation of seven-figure incomes.

Capitalism has failed and must be ended. Socialism is the future. Vote for Kishore and White.

Join Chase in taking direct action to improve our communities, like park and road cleanups, donating to food banks and shelters, and volunteering and fundraising for organizations that supply direct aid to the unhoused.

### Statement  
For my entire life as a Millennial, both Major Parties have been complicit in making the American government unjust, unaccountable, and unsustainable. We’re being dragged down by an institution that is the product of out-of-touch politicians. I have a different vision.  
Let’s protect the environment by cutting subsidies for oil producers, allowing safe nuclear energy, and eliminating crony capitalist protections for polluters. Let’s restore justice by ending qualified immunity and prosecution of victimless crimes. Let’s revive the American Dream by cutting regulations that increase the cost of home construction by over 25%. Let’s empower those saddled with predatory student loans by making them interest-free and dischargeable in bankruptcy. Let’s reduce healthcare costs by ending evergreen patents that keep prices of drugs like insulin high.  
We must balance our budget for future generations. Decades of reckless spending have led to inflation harming every American. Let’s end the wasteful War on Drugs, reform immigration, shrink the surveillance state, and close unnecessary overseas military bases.

## Mike ter Maat  
**Libertarian Party Nominee**  
**Vice President**  

### Elected Experience  
Lifelong public servant.

### Other Professional Experience  
Mike’s career in finance and economics included work with the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as a financial economist, and as a consulting economist to three other federal and international agencies in the field of economic development. Mike was an advocate in DC for free markets in the financial services industry.

### Education  
BS in Aeronautical Engineering. MBA from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. MS and PhD degrees in Economics from The George Washington University.

### Community Service  
Mike is a former police officer who now advocates for comprehensive police reform.

### Statement  
Both Major Parties support tariffs which are a regressive tax on consumers. Tariffs lead to trade wars, which especially hurt families in Washington State where approximately 40% of jobs depend on international trade.  
When goods stop crossing borders, armies will. America has long had the moniker ‘leader of the free world.’ It’s time we earn that distinction by insisting that Peace is the way forward through trade agreements and diplomacy.  
In all aspects of policy, Libertarians pursue reform with one goal: to empower people, not the government. When did rational ideas become radical ideas? If you’re living your life and not using force, fraud, coercion or theft, your life’s your life, your body’s your body, your business is your business, and your property’s your property; it’s not mine, and it’s certainly not the government’s.

## Statement  
**The West/Abdullah Administration’s Blueprint for Transformative Change**  
The West/Abdullah administration’s first 100 days in office would usher in a paradigm shift in American politics, rooted in the tripartite pillars of truth, justice, and love.

### Key initiatives:  
- An executive order to prioritize homelessness and poverty;  
- Radical education reform (including a federal mandate to equalize per-pupil spending across districts) and environmental protection measures (beginning with declaring a climate emergency);  
- Bold steps on healthcare access and gender equality (like publishing the Equal Rights Amendment and codifying abortion rights and body autonomy);  
- Transformative foreign policy and immigration reform (involving immediately halting all funding and weapons transfer to Israel);  
- Concrete actions on racial justice and democratic reform (including financial reparations and land back programs);  
- Prioritization of workers’ rights and labor protections (beginning with drafting a Worker’s Bill of Rights).

## Statement  
Since the 1970’s, the policies of “The Swarm” - the tightly knit and decentralized elites across Left & Right defined at ShatterTheSwarm.com - have intentionally escalated the cost of living on everyday people and have destroyed the life expectancy of Americans.  
If you have a child today, your son or daughter will have a shorter lifespan than you.  
This is what happens when you keep voting for the “lesser of evils” thinking one of the evils will “save you.” They have no interest in saving you, except killing you. The Solution - The truth is you must want to Save Yourself! We need a systems overhaul, which demands a bottoms-up movement by we the people, done by us, and for us. Shiva 4 President - When you vote for Shiva 4 President, you are acknowledging that the “Swarm” and its puppets are out to enslave you. You acknowledge that the only solution is Us, electing one of Us to be our leader.
