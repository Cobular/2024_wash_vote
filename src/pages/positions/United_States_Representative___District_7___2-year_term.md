### Statement  
I am proud to represent Seattle’s 7th district and stand up for poor and working people across our community. As your Congresswoman, I’ve worked to raise wages, lower costs, protect abortion rights, take bold climate action, and invest in affordable housing.  
As Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair, I introduced legislation for Medicare for All, tuition-free college, housing as a human right, expanding workers’ rights, raising the federal minimum wage to $15, humane immigration reform, and an ultra-millionaire wealth tax. I’ve introduced numerous bills to get money out of politics and to ensure ethics in Congress and our Supreme Court.  
I played a critical role in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, which capped the price of insulin at $35 for seniors, empowered Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices, and made the largest climate investment in history. We also passed the first major gun safety law in over 30 years and made historic infrastructure investments.  
As your Congresswoman, I’ve held over 100 town halls to hear from you and helped thousands of constituents – including veterans and seniors – secure millions in federal benefits. My office has worked hard to secure tens of millions in new federal investments in local initiatives for housing, jobs, and more.  
I’m proud to represent a district rich in innovation, diversity, and compassion. I have never taken corporate PAC money because I fight for working people, not the wealthy and well-connected. I came to America alone at 16 years old, and have lived in Seattle for over 30 years. I would be deeply honored to have your vote.  

### Endorsements  
Over 20 labor unions including the Washington State Labor Council, SEIU, UFCW 3000 and Washington State Building & Construction Trades Council. Planned Parenthood, League of Conservation Voters, Sierra Club, and the King County Democrats.

### Statement  
> I have tremendous hope for the future of our country as a beacon of light for people around the world. Through the American principle of self-governance we must protect our freedoms and the right to choose.  
> The great goal of our Congress is to reach fundamental agreement on emerging issues while nurturing progress toward peace, liberty, and dignity. Division within our government has been causing the decline of our country’s strength, influence, and productivity. We must unite the House and pass important legislation.  
> We need a healthy, nourished population that can afford the growing cost of living. We need an infrastructure that gives us the luxuries of modern life while balancing the growing problems with pollution and waste. Domestic investment and on-shoring of work are needed to renew our core principles and establish a new foundation for American growth.  
> The Arts are a defining element of our culture. In an increasingly technological world, it is possible to lose the self; the Arts offer respite. Arts investment is crucial for a healthy society; one that must in this generation find stability.  
> We need peace internationally. Our country must stand for freedom and democratic ideals, but it must also seek lasting peace and security. We must strive to include all nations in our world order; securing lands, lifting sanctions, and promoting increased trade in traditional and emerging industries. We must use our power for the exercise of compassion and human betterment; applying our ethics that happiness is sought not through greed and indifference but through generosity and gratitude.  
> I have resided in downtown Seattle for 14 years. It would be my privilege to apply my energy and background as your representative in Congress. I ask for your vote, and a donation if you are able. Thank you.
