### Statement  
Our district is a tremendously diverse and hard-working community, one that I have been proud to call home my entire life. I grew up in the city of SeaTac. Sara and I raised our two children here, where they attended our public schools, and went to UW and WSU.  

As our nation faces unprecedented challenges, I am focused on strengthening the middle class, ensuring equality of opportunity for all, and investing in our future. We must provide an accessible path forward where everyone can thrive. Working class families, like the union one I grew up in, do not have the same opportunities as previous generations. This needs to change. We must grow from the middle out, increase economic opportunities, protect unions, make higher education more affordable and accessible, and provide good paying jobs.  

All people, no matter their background, should have access to quality, affordable healthcare. Our healthcare system needs to be restructured to create a path to a single-payer plan like Medicare for All. As the past Chairman and top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, I have also prioritized making sure that all of our service members and their families, no matter who they are, receive the support they need and have earned.  

I work hard to make sure every person in our district has access to the best this country has to offer; not only because it’s the right thing to do, but because this is also my home—it’s personal to me.  

It is a true privilege to serve our community and I would be honored to have your vote.

### Statement  
Greetings of peace. I’m a mother, and my father and husband are disabled Veterans. I understand the costs of war, and I’ve stood for peace since childhood. Incumbent leads the Armed Services Committee with no experience of military service. His military budgets alone take $2 billion a year from our district, and he brags bringing back ~$24 million... that’s 1%.  

I stand for a principled foreign policy that prioritizes peace, opposes genocide, and protects innocent lives — especially children. America must use its power for good — promoting human rights and conflict resolution, not military intervention first.  

Incumbent’s top donors are AIPAC and bomb makers (opensecrets.org). He’s voted for every military aid package to apartheid Israel. He’s supported surveillance on Americans, criminalizing free speech, usurping rights, and multiple wars — which enrich his biggest donors.  

My campaign is grassroots funded, and I will oppose all military aid to oppressive regimes. I’ll prioritize issues that matter most to our beautifully diverse communities — a thriving economy, accessible healthcare, affordable housing, quality education, good union jobs, small business support, vocational training, childcare, fair and dignified immigration, community safety, and modern infrastructure. We can afford all this by wasting less on foreign wars.  

I stand for Constitutional rights: privacy, freedom of speech and assembly, equality before the law. I’m not a career politician. I’m a proud American — heartbroken, hardworking, and hopeful. I’ve worked in agriculture, housing, and climate resilience. I’ve also curated human geography insights for national leaders. I’m an urgent optimist with real experience, deep empathy, and the right mindset to lead us into a future where America is a thriving, prosperous, multiracial democracy in a vibrant and peaceful world.  

Elect me for meaningful representation of our shared values. “With Liberty and Justice for All” is my promise and commitment.
