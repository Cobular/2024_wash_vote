### Statement  
Affordability. Jobs. Rights. Security. That’s what I focus on as your representative in Washington, D.C., not hyper-partisan politics.  

**Affordability:** Food, energy, housing, education, childcare, and prescription drugs all cost way too much. That’s why I helped cap monthly insulin costs at $35 for Medicare enrollees and am fighting drug middlemen that inflate drug prices. My law made manipulating energy markets a crime, allowing the government to claw back billions in ill-gotten profits. I championed tax credits that built millions of affordable housing units and made childcare more affordable.  

**Jobs:** Bringing manufacturing and supply chains back home are the key to creating jobs, raising wages, and growing the middle class. I developed a new law that is bolstering STEM education and apprenticeships, and will triple U.S. semiconductor manufacturing capacity. Our agricultural economy is stronger because we stood up to foreign shippers and reopened markets for Washington apples and lentils. We kept freight moving with record new infrastructure investments. I improved access to credit for small businesses and created more opportunities for women- and minority-owned businesses.  

**Rights:** Freedoms we once took for granted are under assault. I’ve been fighting to codify Roe v. Wade, protect access to contraceptives and IVF, and block anti-choice states from prosecuting women. Washingtonians have a right to clean air and water, which is why I led efforts to protect pristine public lands, restore salmon habitat, and transition away from fossil fuels.  

**Security:** Fentanyl is devastating too many Washington communities, so my new law declares fentanyl a national emergency and gives local law enforcement more resources to stop it from crossing our borders. Veterans have served our nation, which is why I have fought to protect their health care, including 124,000 Washingtonians exposed to toxic materials.  

I am asking for your support in the U.S. Senate race.

# United States Senator | 6-year term

## Dr Raul Garcia  
*(Prefers GOP Party)*

### Elected Experience

### Other Professional Experience  
- Doctor, Emergency Medicine, 25 years.

- Graduate, New York College of Osteopathic Medicine.

### Community Service  
- Co-founder, Partnership for Food Security.  
- Local drives for domestic violence shelter, toys for sick kids, bikes for books, and feeding the homeless.

### Statement  
This election is an opportunity for the people of Washington to change the way we are governed, to stop the cycle of divisive politics that ignores the best interests of our people.  
Serious crises aren’t getting the attention they should. Fentanyl is an extremely dangerous drug that is killing Americans indiscriminately. Dr. Garcia, an Emergency Room physician, sees far too many overdoses, and knows far too many families who’ve lost loved ones. Dr. Garcia is the only Senate candidate with a plan to seriously combat the Fentanyl crisis, using a proven approach that targets dealers with prison time, and helps addicts with a robust program of treatment and recovery.  
Another crisis is the cost of living. Washington is the fourth most-expensive state for groceries, and the eighth most-expensive overall. Many people are at or near the end of their financial rope due to rampant inflation. We can help tackle inflation by stopping reckless federal spending that adds to the national debt, and boost productivity to ease prices for consumers. Dr. Garcia will be a voice for fiscal sanity.  
As an Emergency Room doctor, Dr. Garcia spends his days helping people. As a refugee from Cuba who found a home in America, he loves our country deeply. As a son raised by a single mother, he respects the men and women who work so hard to make a life for themselves and their families.  
Dr. Garcia isn’t a career politician. But throughout his life he has been a leader – in the medical profession and in the community. He serves patients as a doctor, and he will serve the people of Washington as their US Senator.  
Our state is a wonderful place that has gone a bit off-track. We can definitely do better, and with Dr. Raul Garcia we will.
